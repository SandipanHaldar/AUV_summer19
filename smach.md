# Smach tutorials
Smach, which stands for "State Machine", is a powerful and scalable Python-based library for hierarchical state machines. The Smach library does not depend on ROS, and can be used in any Python project. The executive_smach stack however provides very nice integration with ROS, including smooth actionlib integration and a powerful Smach viewer to visualize and introspect state machines.
