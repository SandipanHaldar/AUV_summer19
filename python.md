# Some basics of python
## Creating Variables
* Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
* Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.
* A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
* The Python print statement is often used to output variables.
To combine both text and a variable, Python uses the + character
## Python numbers
* There are three numeric types in Python:
1. int
1. float
1. complex
Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them.
To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function.
* Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.
* Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:
## Strings
String literals in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks
'hello' is the same as "hello".
Strings can be output to screen using the print function. For example: print("hello").
* Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.
